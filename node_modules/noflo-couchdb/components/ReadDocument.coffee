# Ports:
#   In:   URL Inherited from CouchDbComponentBase parent class to receive connection information to CouchDB.
#             When a URL is received, the parent constructor will create an @dbConnection for us.
#         IN  Created in this class to receive document IDs to look up in CouchDB.  The data contents on this
#             port should be simple strings.
#
#   Out:  LOG Inherited from LoggingComponent to send log messages for error handling.
#         OUT Created in this class to send whole documents that were read from CouchDB.
